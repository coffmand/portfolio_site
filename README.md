# Project: portfolio_site
#### Author/Developer: Don Coffman
Project 2 in Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree (FSND) Program (2018)


## Description:
This a foundational Project in the FSND Program, creating a personal electronic Portfolio Web Site
highlighting the formal Udacity projects completed by the Author/Developer.
For each project listed, the web page provides the following:
- A graphic _poster_ image representing the project
- The Project Name
- A hyperlink to the developer's GitHub repository for that project

  (_Note_: Currently (4) of the (6) projects have yet to be completed, so their information is a placeholder.
          As the projects are completed, the portfolio_site web page will be updated to include the actual
          project information.)

One of the key requirements for the portfolio_site project web page is its ability to provide content in a responsive
manner, based on the viewing area available across a wide variety of electronic devices. (ie: phone, tablet, desktop, etc.)
The goal of this is to create an enjoyable User Experience when the page is accessed, regardless of the viewing device.
In order to demonstrate the developer's understanding and expertise in providing this functionality, the HTML and CSS code for this project
was manually generated, (ie: no CSS framework used) utilizing media-queries and customized responsive graphic image data.
